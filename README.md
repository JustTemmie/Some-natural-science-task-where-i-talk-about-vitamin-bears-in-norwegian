# Some-natural-science-task-where-i-talk-about-vitamin-bears-in-norwegian

this is uh, an interesting project i had
it's basically just a fork of an rpg game i was working on at the time so there's a fair bit of unused code, the structure is also almost non existant and there's a bunch of empty files
this was all made in the span of something like a week? idk i'm writting this 3 months afterwards, readability wasn't exactly my focus
